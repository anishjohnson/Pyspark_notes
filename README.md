Pyspark:
========
Apache Sparkâ„¢ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
PySpark provides a programming model based on RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets), which are immutable distributed collections of objects that can be processed in parallel. 
PySpark also provides a DataFrame API, which is an abstraction on top of RDDs that provides a more structured and optimized way of working with data. 
PySpark supports a wide range of data sources, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache Cassandra, and Amazon S3, among others.
